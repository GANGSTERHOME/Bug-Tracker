# Bug-Tracker
This is a baisc Bug Tracker DApp made by me. I have used React, Web3.js and Solidity Smart contract, along with Bootstrap for styling.
If you want to use it, you will have to download the NPM, Bootstrap and Web3 using terminal before starting the app on browser.
In the Bug.js file, you need to provide the smart contract address and abi after deploying the smart contract. Here, I have used Ganache a local blockchain, you can use it too.
Thanks.
